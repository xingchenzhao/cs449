# cs449
These are projects for CS449 (Intro to Systems Programming)

# Project1
The first program is called Hangman which is a game for guessing words.**
The second program is a Wav Editor.**
# Project2
This project was very difficult. Implement a custom malloc function. This required thinking about how malloc worked and how objects and pointers in memory were stored. We need to find the passwords that needed to be entered into the programs, given 3 compiled executables. This task required decompiling to assembly, by using gdb and other techniques.
# Project3
We need to implement a custom malloc program which required thinking about how malloc worked and how objects and pointers in memory were stored.
# Project4
We need to implement a costom shell program involved using threading and syscalls.
